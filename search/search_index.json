The disadvantage with this method is that it is not fault tolerant meaning if one disk fails then all the data is lost. RAID 1 uses a mirroring technique to duplicate data across multiple disks. The advantage of this method is that if one single disk gets damaged or corrupted then no data loss will occur.

NAS device is optimised for serving files either by its hardware, software, or configurations. NAS system are networked appliances that contain one or more storage drives. A NAS topically provides access to files across a network. From the mid-1990s, NAS devices began gaining popularity as a convenient method od sharing files among multiple computers, as well as to remove the responsibility of file serving from other servers on the network; by doing sp, a NAS can provide faster data access easier administration, and simpler configuration as opposed to using general-purpose server to serve files. data processing data processing systems computer systems can be characterised by and constructed around the data they are expected to process, so when a set of inputs is given a defined set of inputs are produced. What defines good data What defines good data. features is that it is accurate, consistent, complete, relevant, timely, reliable, secure and economical. accurate: the data is correct and free from errors. consistent: the data is consistent with other data. complete: the data is complete and does not contain any missing data. relevant: the data is relevant to the purpose it is being used for. timely: the data is up to date and not out of date. reliable: checking more then one source to make sure the data is correct. economical: how easy and fast is it to collect the data. secure: the data is secure and cannot be accessed by anyone else. good date input methods Input data may have to be manual, for example, paper forms questionnaires ect. but where possible human error wil be eliminated by automating the data entry process. input forms, menus drp down boxes and buttons can all be used to help eliminate data entry error by humans as it is easier to validate and verify as the information is being input into the system.

UMA VS NUMA uniform memory accesses UMA stands for Uniform Memory Access. In Uniform Memory Access, Single memory controller is used. Uniform Memory Access is slower than non-uniform Memory Access. Uniform Memory Access has limited bandwidth. Uniform Memory Access is applicable for general purpose applications and time-sharing applications. In uniform Memory Access, memory access time is balanced or equal. There are 3 types of buses used in uniform Memory Access which are: Single, Multiple and Crossbar. Examples of UMA architecture- Sun Starfire Servers Compaq alpha server HP v series non-uniform memory accesses NUMA stands for Non-uniform Memory Access. In Non-uniform Memory Access, Different memory controller is used. Non-uniform Memory Access is faster than uniform Memory Access. Non-uniform Memory Access has more bandwidth than uniform Memory Access. Non-uniform Memory Access is applicable for real-time applications and time-critical applications. In non-uniform Memory Access, memory access time is not equal. While in non-uniform Memory Access, There are 2 types of buses used which are: Tree and hierarchical.
